this directory contains sudoku solver codes.


One code is made in python and uses backtracking to build the resultant matrix

the second code is made in c++ and uses pointers and and ordered structure
the ordered structures works similarly to an ordered queue
the second code is capable of finding a solution only if one solution exists
if multiple solutions exists, it will stop when you reach the sudoku matrix from where multiple solutions bifurcate
