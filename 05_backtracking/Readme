this directory contains sudoku solver codes and a 8 queens game solver code.


the 8 queens game solver finds all possible solutions for this specific problem by using back tracking

One sudoku solver code is made in python and uses backtracking to build the resultant matrix

the second code is made in c++ and uses pointers and an ordered structure
the ordered structure works similarly to an ordered queue
the second code is capable of finding a solution only if one solution exists
if multiple solutions exists, it will stop when you reach the sudoku matrix from where multiple solutions bifurcate
